Start Bootstrap - SB Admin 2
=========

This is a modified version (see angularmod branch). It uses Angular.js to organize
better the page contents. HTML regarding menus are all in a single file
(templates/navigation.html), while the real content are all in the partials folder,
without the code from menus.

It also loads the page contents without refreshing the whole page, thanks to Angular.js.

Enjoy.
